Mag-iT: Application to detect text in an image and read that text to facilitate farsighted people

# About The Project
In this project, we are targeting farsighted people, a condition in which visual images come to a focus behind the retina of the eye, and vision is better for distant objects than for near objects. We design an user-friendly application that will help people to read a text, scan it, read it or listen to it.  Same as how the magnifying glassworks, but we make the application version and it more advanced. Based on seeing how farsighted people have a difficult time when reading or seeing near objects. As mentioned before, it is easy to use. Using a camera or screenshot the text and the app will detect and be able to turn it into a voice, so no worries we still can find out what itâ€™s written by listening to it.
